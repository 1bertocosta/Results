# WP RESULTS WordPress plugin

The mission of this project is to enable create web applications by only few clicks. 
"Wp Results" consist of two main modules:

1. Form to input and process data. 
2. Composer to display storaged data.  

Ultimately, I would like to post kits ready to build apps and portals like: work portals, photostocks, event portals, complex ecommerce apps and web solutions. The road to this goal will be implement dedicated CRM form processes.

At first I'll try show how to create [work portal](https://github.com/dadmor/Results/wiki/WorkPortal-Example).
